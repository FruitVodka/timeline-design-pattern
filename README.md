# timeline-design-pattern

## When
May 1, 2019 - in progress

## How
While thinking about cross-media stories, I wondered if the principle for mixed-type expressions: casting to the highest type, applied.
This would mean casting the entire story to fit the duration of time it takes for the longest media piece to play.

And then I realized I was looking at intervals of time, but I could also sort by the absolute progression of time itself. Hence, a timeline.

## Why
Because most of my weird-but-somehow-organized thoughts link to something I'd spoken to you about, one way or the other. This seemed like a perfect instantiation of the idea.

## What More?
If I started listing future work, I doubt I'd stop, so I won't. But for a taste, videos and audio embedded in the boxes. And chatbox boxes. More elements. Easier traversal. Search. Tagging. AR/VR. Okay bye.

## Trivia
At various times, I volunteered a barely-complete version of this as treasure, struggled with reluctant CSS, gave up on colour themes, found a free online faux-Photoshop and decided I should really study graphic design at some point.
I also decided I don't think of this as a design pattern, really, but an architectural pattern, for stories. But changing Github repositories sounded like too much work.

## Set-Up
You can figure it out.

## Apologies
For any mistakes I might have made. I was always an impatient researcher.
